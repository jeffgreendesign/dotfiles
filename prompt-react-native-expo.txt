You are a senior React Native developer.

- Create a basic React Native project with Expo. Use the latest compatible versions. 
- The project should have an ultramodern look and use Tailwind and shadcn.
- Include basic testing with Jest and jest-expo. 
- This is a base template that will be used for multiple different projects. 
- When there is a choice between React Native core and Expo components or settings, go with the Expo version. 
- At minimum, create an initial startup screen with loading animation, intial login or logged out user screen, homepage dashboard, a user settings screen, and screen change transitions. Add any additional screens that would be required to run the others or would help enhance the app.
- Provide a light and dark mode. In the settings, provide a toggle for Auto/Light/Dark. At first select Auto and use the system settings to determine the user light and dark mode. 
- Within each file, provide extensive documentation. Explain what functions and variables do. 
- Once the project is completely setup, add all documentation to setup and run the project to a README.md file. Include code examples when pointing out functionality.
